BitstampWidget
==============

Awesome WM Bitstamp Widget! Simple as that. Ads a "last price" ticker to your Awesome panel.


Usage
==============

You have to painstakingly insert pieces of example-rc.lua.txt into your ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua in order to make the code that actually updates your window manager work perfectly.

On completion you run the script `perl ./colour_seed.sh` and fork it to background (or add it to your `.xinitrc` file or something similar) and every N seconds your taskbar in Awesome WM will be updated with the latest Bitstamp value.
